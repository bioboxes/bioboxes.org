# Validate your Biobox

After creating your biobox you should validate the image to ensure its follows
the specification. This validation ensures that your image behaves as expected
when given to an end user. This means more work in the short term, however
ultimately it should mean your image is easier to use and gets used more often.

Bioboxes provides tool to help your validate your image as you are building it.
This tool should be used often to ensure your assembler keeps working as you
make changes or modify it. The [bioboxes assembler validator][] tool describes
how you can use this to validate your container.

### Example

This example first downloads and extracts the latest release of the validator.
Then tests the `default` task of the velvet image.

~~~ shell
# Fetch the latest 0.1.x release of the validator
wget https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/bioboxes-tools/validate-short-read-assembler/0.1.x/validate-short-read-assembler.tar.gz
tar xzf validate-short-read-assembler.tar.gz

./validate-short-read-assembler/validate velvet default
~~~

You can find the final [biobox velvet][] example in our Github repository.
In the section [using a biobox image] you find a tutorial with example data that explains
how to use your biobox.
