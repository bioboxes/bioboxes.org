# Create a Task

Tasks allow the same assembler to be run with different combinations of
parameters. You can also think of a task as a command bundle that groups
different command line flags together into a simpler interface. This guide
describes using tasks in your image.

The a biobox interface requires that a container be called with a `task`
parameter. This follows the name of the biobox when using `docker run`.
 
~~~shell
docker run [OPTIONS] BIOBOX_NAME TASK
~~~

You should use tasks to describe the different ways your software can be run.
Using genome assembly as an example, there might be a way to run an assembler
that create large contigs but at the same time may contain errors. There may
also be a separate way to run an assembler more carefully which results in
smaller more correct contigs. These different ways of running the same software
are the reason tasks are used.

Each biobox should provide a `default` task which should be the set of command
line flags that work best in most situations. The task should later be provided
to your run command:

### Example

In this velvet example we'll create a script that provides two tasks.
We'll define this in a file called `Taskfile`. You can see this `Taskfile`
contains in the `default` task the commands to run velvet along with environment variables.

~~~ shell
default: velveth ${TMP_DIR} 31 -fastq.gz ${READS} && velvetg ${TMP_DIR} -cov_cutoff auto
careful: velveth ${TMP_DIR} 91 -fastq.gz ${READS} && velvetg ${TMP_DIR} -cov_cutoff 10
~~~

The second task has a larger kmer size and sets a low assembly coverage cutoff.
The Taskfile is added in your Dockerfile with an `ADD` command. In the next section you will see
how you can access the task with a simple shell command. Another task could be for example:

~~~ shell
default: velveth ${TMP_DIR} 31 -fastq.gz ${READS} && velvetg ${TMP_DIR} -cov_cutoff auto
~~~
