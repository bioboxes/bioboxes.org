# Biobox developer guide

Bioboxes provides an interface definition to allow Docker containers of the
same type to be interchangeable. This guide provides a step-by-step description
for creating a simple [velvet][] assembler biobox. We recommend you complete the
[biobox user guide][user] in order to understand Bioboxes and basic Docker commands before beginning this guide.
The final velvet biobox is available in our [Github][] repository. This guide requires familiarity with basic [unix commands][] and
basic [Docker][] commands.
